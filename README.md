# Introduction

I'm having trouble figuring out how to start a repository on my local machine and push a new branch to Github

# Situation

I can create the repository and create the branch, the terminal says the push goes through fine but the new branch only contains the old information. Keeping notes so I can keep track of what I'm missing.


# Observation 1

I noticed that even though I correctly pushed, and the terminal states everything is up to date, that the text editor wanted me to save the files. I wonder if I have to save on my local machine (outside of git add .) and then push?

# Test save theory 1

I am going to make this change, save on my local machine and then git add . > git commit > git push
